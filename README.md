lab reports

Fit a first order plus time delay (FOPTD) model for your system using the data collected in the
previous step. Report the model parameters obtained for all the reaction curves and determine their
average values. Compare the observed reaction curves with the first-principles model predictions
obtained in Lab #1-Part 1. In your analysis, focus on discussing trends and characteristics rather than
absolute values. Discuss all possible sources of errors/deviations.

For the open loop, empirical modeling component (Part 2), include the following:
Summary of experimental observations: present your experimental data as graphs (e.g., reaction
curves) and provide a succinct but complete description of any relevant issue or observation that
might have affected your experimental work (e.g., valve FCV-101 was leaking). Tabulate all relevant
experimental measurements.

Empirical model: Prepare a table indicating the model parameter values (gain, time constant, time
delay) for each reaction curve, and include also the average value for each model parameter.
Analysis and discussion: compare experimental and first-principles model predictions. Discuss
potential reasons to explain observed differences, and any potential sources of errors. Discuss the
potential impact that changes in process transfer functions might have on the performance of a
controller.

Cite any and all sources you used in your work in a consistent fashion. All references listed must be
cited at least once in the report.

Provide a copy of your Python code (it can be submitted as an additional file in the designated dropbox
in D2L).
